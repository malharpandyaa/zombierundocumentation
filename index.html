    <h1>Project Outline</h1>
    <p>The game is a temple run inspired game which is 2D. There is a start screen with the title and it tells the user to press S to start the game. When playing the game, there is a scoreboard and level number shown on the top left side. For every obstacle dodged, the player gets 1 point. Every 5 points, the level increases by 1 and the speed of the obstacles coming also increases. As you cross more levels, the game gets quicker and therefore harder. If the player hits an obstacle, a game over screen pops up with the score and the level at which the game ended.</p>

    <h1>Narrative</h1>
    <p>It is an apocalyptic world where the main character is a zombie running and dodging harmful obstacles such as big sharp needles and squares.</p>

    <h1>Future Development</h1>
    <p>I should use sprite animation for the zombie and the obstacles to make it look better and also have a live background that matches the theme.</p>
